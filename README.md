# ReactiveUI AOT repro

NOTE: ReactiveUI is added as a submodule so you will need to `git submodule init` that

There are 3 projects to show the 3 scenarios:

- **ReactiveTestClean**. This is a sanity check of our build/run scripts and codesigning. Its an out-of-the-box MAUI app generated by `dotnet new maui` using p12 and dotnet 6.0.2xx daily
- **ReactiveTestPackage**. This is the "ideal" / target config. It just adds a PackageReference to the ReactiveUI packages we are trying to target.
- **ReactiveTestLocal**. This is the "workaround" setup. It adds ReactiveUI as a ProjectReference and adds some Reactive code references to validate it will pass through to the .ipa generation.

There are 2 scripts to test run scenarios:

- **scripts/run-ios.sh**. This tests running with a dev cert against a plugged in device.
- **scripts/build-ios.sh**. This tests building a release config and generating a signed .ipa from that .app file.

You can pass 'clean', 'package', or 'local' to the scripts to test that scenario. e.g. `./scripts/run-ios.sh local`

In the current state, I can run each project successfully using `run-ios.sh`, but I can't build `ReactiveTestPackage` using `build-ios.sh`.

### NOTE: you will need to add/edit your own codesigning keys / app-ids / profiles. You will see how I have it setup in the `.csproj` files, but I've removed my personal/company info.
